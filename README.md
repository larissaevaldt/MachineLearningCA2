# Machine Learning CA2

## Can we predict if a patient won’t show (no show) for an appointment?

### Requirements 

You are required to take the dataset “Medical Appointment No Shows.csv” and using either KNN or Naïve Bayes, make a prediction if a patient will be a “no show or a show” at their medical appointment. The output of your program must:
1. Visualize the data and prediction
2. Print out the message: “The patient will: ” (show/No show):-Dependant on your prediction.
3. Compare Model accuracy (KNN VS Naïve Bayes)
4. Print out the accuracy or error of the ML model you are using.
5. Explain in the mark-up (As Text) why you picked the specific algorithm
6. Explain in the mark-up (As Text) your code
